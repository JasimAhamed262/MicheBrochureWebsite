The primary goal of this project was to design and develop a responsive,visually engaging, brochure style landing page for a fictional juice brand ("Miche's"). This simulates a real-world client requirement for a digital product showcase focusing on user experience (UX) and brand storytelling.

This project demonstrates strong foundational skills in core frontend technologies and an eye for modern UI design:

Implemented custom, scroll-triggered CSS animations (e.g., fade-ins, parallax effects) to create a dynamic and storytelling driven browsing experience effectively attracting and retaining user attention.

Used JavaScript to handle complex user interactions, such as navigation bar sticky behavior, smooth scrolling, and carousel functionality (if applicable), ensuring a highly professional and polished feel.
